Integrated length-based stock assessment model 

This stock assessment model was created by Andre Punt and Simon de Lestang for assessing the stock dynamics of hard to age fish stocks.
It is designed to be very flexible, capable of replicating multiple timesteps, spatial areas, fleets across size (e.g. length) classes and ages.
The model code is written in C++ to be run through TMB.
